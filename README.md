# Excel_Sales_And_Finance_Project_Of_AtliQ_Hardware

Project Overview
AtliQ Hardware, a leading global provider of hardware solutions specializing in PCs, printers, mice, and computers, aims to enhance sales performance and improve net gross margins and profitability. To achieve these objectives, the Sales Director sought actionable insights beyond the traditional reports provided by regional managers. The unstructured nature of the sales data demanded a robust data analysis approach to uncover potential opportunities for improvement.

As a Data Analyst, I spearheaded this project to analyze a comprehensive dataset of over half a million unorganized sales records. The process involved extensive data organization, transformation, and analysis (ETL) to derive meaningful insights. The ultimate goal was to empower AtliQ Hardware with data-driven strategies to optimize key performance indicators (KPIs) and drive significant business improvements.
